### PIR Passive Infrared sensor

The PIR (Passive Infra-Red) Sensor is a pyroelectric device that detects motion by sensing changes in the
infrared (radiant heat) levels emitted by surrounding objects. This motion can be detected by checking
for a sudden change in the surrounding IR pattern. When motion is detected the PIR sensor outputs a
high signal on its output pin.
